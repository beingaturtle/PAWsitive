 ## Pitch
Many students often tend to forgo their personal wellbeing for the sake of external factors, such as grades. Our app is design to help students become more conscientious about their own wellbeing by game-ifying healthy activities. Through our app, we wish for students will build a healthy daily routine that will lead to better wellbeing in the long term.
