## Pitch

Do you want to play video games and improve your mental health at the same time? Well look no further, Pawisitive is an app that allows you to do just that!
<br>
Many students often tend to forgo their personal wellbeing for the sake of external factors, such as grades. Our app is designed to help students become more conscientious about their own wellbeing by game-ifying healthy activities. Through our app, we wish for students to build a healthy daily routine that will lead to better health and wellbeing in the long term.
